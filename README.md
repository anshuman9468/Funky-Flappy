**Funky Flappy 🐦**
**A Flappy Bird-inspired arcade game developed using the BMAD Game Development Agent and Godot Engine as part of an exploration into AI-assisted game development.**

**📖 About**
**Funky Flappy** is a modern take on the classic Flappy Bird gameplay, built to demonstrate the capabilities of AI-assisted game development workflows. The project leverages the BMAD (Build, Manage, Architect, Develop) agent system to generate core gameplay logic, structure the project architecture, and accelerate the development process through intelligent agent-driven workflows.

**🎮 Features**

Classic Flappy Bird-style gameplay mechanics
Clean, funky visual design
Score tracking system
Collision detection and physics
Built with Godot Engine for cross-platform compatibility
AI-generated architecture and gameplay logic via BMAD

**🛠️ Technology Stack**

Game Engine: Godot Engine
Development Agent: BMAD (Build, Manage, Architect, Develop)
Programming: GDScript
Version Control: Git/GitHub

**🚀 Getting Started**
Prerequisites

Godot Engine (version 4.x recommended)
Git
BMAD Game Development Agent (optional, for development)

**Installation**

Clone the repository

bash   git clone https://github.com/anshu713-cloud/web-bundles.git
   cd "Flappy bird/web-bundles"

**Open in Godot**

Launch Godot Engine
Click "Import"
Navigate to the project directory
Select project.godot
Click "Import & Edit"


**Run the game**

Press F5 or click the "Play" button in Godot
Enjoy the game!



**🎯 How to Play**

Tap/Click/Spacebar: Make the bird flap and fly upward
Objective: Navigate through the obstacles without crashing
Score: Earn points by successfully passing through gaps
Challenge: Beat your high score!

**🤖 BMAD Integration**
This project showcases the integration of the BMAD Game Development Agent, which assisted in:

Architecture Generation: Created the initial project structure and file organization
Gameplay Logic: Generated core game mechanics and physics systems
Code Scaffolding: Provided foundational code for various game components
Workflow Automation: Streamlined development through agent-driven processes

For more information about the agent workflows, see AGENTS.md.

**📂 Key Directories**

assets/: Contains all game assets including sprites, sounds, and fonts
src/: Source code for game logic, player controller, obstacle management, and UI
_bmad_output/: AI-generated architecture and documentation files
.bmad-*: Configuration modules for different BMAD capabilities

**🔧 Development**
Working with BMAD
The project includes several BMAD modules configured for different development tasks:

godot-game-dev: Godot-specific game development workflows
2d-phaser-game-dev: Alternative 2D game development patterns
infrastructure-devops: Deployment and infrastructure management
creative-writing: Narrative and content generation
