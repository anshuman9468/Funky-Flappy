PROJECT: Flappy Bird Clone (Web Game)

GOAL:
Create a simple, smooth, and responsive Flappy Bird–style 2D game that runs in the browser.

GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS:
- Player controls a bird that continuously falls due to gravity
- On click / spacebar / tap, the bird jumps upward
- Vertical pipes move from right to left
- Player must pass through pipe gaps without collision
- Game ends on collision with pipes or ground
- Score increases by 1 each time the bird successfully passes a pipe pair

CONTROLS:
- Desktop: Spacebar or Mouse Click
- Mobile: Screen Tap

GAME LOGIC:
- Gravity constantly pulls bird down
- Jump applies upward velocity
- Pipes spawn at fixed time intervals
- Pipe gap height is randomized within limits
- Collision detection between bird and pipes/ground
- Restart option after game over

VISUALS:
- Simple 2D cartoon style
- Background sky (light blue)
- Bird as a circle or sprite
- Pipes as green rectangles
- Ground strip at bottom
- Score displayed at top center

AUDIO (OPTIONAL):
- Jump sound
- Score sound
- Game over sound

TECH STACK:
- HTML5 Canvas
- JavaScript (no external libraries)
- CSS for layout only

PERFORMANCE:
- Smooth 60 FPS animation using requestAnimationFrame
- Responsive canvas scaling for different screen sizes

GAME STATES:
- Start Screen (Tap to Start)
- Playing State
- Game Over Screen with Restart button

CODE STRUCTURE:
- Separate logic for:
  - Bird physics
  - Pipe generation
  - Collision detection
  - Rendering
  - Game state handling

DELIVERABLES:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- Fully playable Flappy Bird clone

CONSTRAINTS:
- No external game engines
- Keep code clean, modular, and commented
- Easy to understand for beginners
